# Unreal Engine Final Project

This is my final project built in **Unreal Engine 5** using the [Unreal Learning Kit](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/learning-kit). It’s a small, interactive 3D environment designed to demonstrate gameplay mechanics, environment design, and blueprint scripting.

## 🎮 Features

- Custom environment built using Unreal's Learning Kit assets
- Player movement, camera controls, and interactive elements
- Level design focused on navigation and player engagement
- Blueprint-based scripting for logic and interactivity

## 📂 Project Structure

This repo includes the full Unreal project:
- `Content/`: All custom and asset-based content
- `Intermediate/`, `Saved/`: Auto-generated files
- `UnrealLearningKit3.uproject`: Project file

## 🛠️ How to Open

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `UnrealLearningKit3.uproject` in **Unreal Engine 5**

Let me know if you want a version that explains specific gameplay or puzzle mechanics you built, or if you want to add GIFs, videos, or screenshots. You can also rename the repo to something more descriptive, like `UE5-Final-Platformer` or `Unreal-Level-Design-Final`, for better clarity.
